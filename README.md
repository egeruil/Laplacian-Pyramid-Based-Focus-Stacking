# Laplacian-Pyramid-Based-Focus-Stacking
This project implements a robust focus stacking pipeline that fuses multiple images taken at different focal depths into a single all-in-focus image. It utilizes Laplacian Pyramid fusion with sharpness-based decision masks and includes an ECC-based image alignment step.
